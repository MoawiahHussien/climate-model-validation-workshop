# ArcGIS-Compatible NetCDF Files - Usage Guide

## Files Information
- Location: Models.Nc.ArcGIS.Compatible/
- Format: NetCDF4 with CF-1.8 conventions
- Spatial Reference: WGS84 (EPSG:4326)
- Coverage: AMMAN ZARQA (JORDAN) basin
- Period: 1990-2014 daily data

## ArcGIS Usage Instructions

### Loading in ArcMap:
1. Add Data -> Navigate to the NetCDF file
2. The file should be recognized as a multidimensional raster
3. You can create raster layers from the multidimensional data
4. Use "Make NetCDF Raster Layer" tool if needed

### Loading in ArcGIS Pro:
1. Add Data -> Multidimensional Raster -> Browse to NetCDF file
2. The spatial reference should be automatically recognized
3. You can visualize different time steps and create animations

### Key Variables:
- tasmaxAdjust: Daily maximum temperature (degrees C)
- crs: Coordinate reference system information
- time: Time dimension (daily from 1990-2014)
- lat: Latitude coordinates (degrees north)
- lon: Longitude coordinates (degrees east)

### Notes:
- Points outside the AMMAN ZARQA basin boundary are masked as NoData
- Use the multidimensional tools to work with the time series
- The CRS is embedded and should be automatically recognized

### Troubleshooting:
If ArcGIS still doesn't recognize the spatial reference:
1. Try using "Define Projection" tool and specify WGS84
2. Check that you're using ArcGIS 10.3+ or ArcGIS Pro 2.0+
3. Ensure the NetCDF file isn't corrupted by checking file size

## Workshop Context:
- Basin: AMMAN ZARQA (JORDAN)
- Target Stations: AL0019, AL0035, AL0059
- Purpose: Climate model validation demonstration
